// Exercise 1: Simple If/Else Statement
// Instructions
// Create 2 variables, x and y. Each of them should have a different numeric value.
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
// Write an if/else statement that checks which number is bigger.

// x is the biggest number
x > y ? console.log('x is bigger than y') : console.log('y is bigger than x.');
